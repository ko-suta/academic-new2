# Why current research matters

- Growing importance of telework, especially due to the COVID-19 impact `r fa("globe-asia", fill = "blue")`

--

- Challenge of replicating corporate operations remotely granting the importance of face-to-face interactions `r fa("globe-asia", fill = "blue")`

--

- Distinct corporate institutional arrangements in Japan (.white.bg-black[relational finance] & .white.bg-black[stakeholder governance]) `r fa("arrow-right", fill = "blue")`

--

- Chance to re-create optimal work-life balance by combining office work and telework `r fa("arrow-right", fill = "blue")`


--

<br>

<ru-blockquote>Organizations are social communities in which individual and social expertise is transformed into economically useful products and services
.right[— <cite>`r TextCite(myBib, "kogut1992os", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear", style = "html"))`</cite>]</ru-blockquote>

- .white.bg-black[However], during the last 30 years, Japan has witnessed **institutional** `r fa("random", fill = "blue")` , as **market influence** has `r fa("arrow-up", fill = "blue")`


???

* legislation promoting market competition has been toughened -- 2005 amendment of Japan's Anti-Monopoly Act

* entry barriers lowered for pharmaceuticals during the late-1990s, which paved a path to a more intensive industrial competition

* similar processes have been observed in Japan's electric sector since mid-1990s, leading to a higher R&D efficiency as well as more intensive patenting

* these developments invited further attention to changing market perceptions of corporate innovations amid the ongoing balance shift from the institutional towards a more market-based industrial model

# RQ & Hypotheses

.black.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
What are the main factors affecting productivity and job satisfaction in an online environment?]

--
> **Hypothesis 1**
>
The perceived telework productivity is higher for .white.bg-black[individual] than for .white.bg-black[collective] tasks.

???

* R&D stock is a long-term institutional signaling; attribute of a **network-based** business approach that works in the regulated and coordinated environment

--

> **Hypothesis 2**
>
Managers and recipients of “seniority-merit” wages are less productive in an online environment than, respectively, ordinary employees and recipients of “performance-based” wages.

???

- Patents' quantity and quality are preconditions for successfully waging market **competition**. Here, not only the mere R&D spending, but rather **R&D efficiency** matters

--

> **Hypothesis 3**
>
TSE positively evaluates influential patents judged by the number of citations accruing to them.
This represents the .white.bg-black[qualitative-market] aspect of innovative policies.

# Data

.panelset.sideways[
.panel[.panel-name[Sample features]

- 1000 employees (sourced via the marketing company)

- 44 out of 47 Japanese prefectures 

- 600 males \& 400 females

- 50\% employed in SMEs (< 1000 workers); 50\% -- in large companies 
]


.panel[.panel-name[Telework-related comfort]

```{r echo=FALSE, include=TRUE, out.width = "45%", fig.align='center', fig.cap = 'Telework productivity'}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/img/Q37-TeleComfortRanking2.png")

# Conclusions

--

> 
**1.** Institutional features associated with .white.bg-black[R&D spending] provide valuable signals for investors across multiple industries.
>

???

* Most of the companies, but especially the ones belonging to **Pharm** and **Chemical** industries are still embedded in a system of industrial coordination. Oligopolistic features still prevalent

--

> 
**2.** Quality of a patented output .white.bg-black[(Citations per Patent)] mostly matters for the manufacturing sector.
>

???

* Thereby these companies react to the accumulating competitive pressures and are redefining themselves within an open-market system

--

> 
**3.** Pronounced nonlinear trend in the market perception of .white.bg-black[corporate age]: only the more experienced companies receive market premium as they get older.
>


--

## Limitations

* Only utilized the JPO data, need to look at **Triadic Patents** as well

* Find out the updated **depreciation rates** for the knowledge stocks (per industry) 

* Possibly including **corporate governance** and **shareholding structure** to better capture the institutional aspects of innovation
