# Why this research matters

- ### Growing importance of telework, especially due to the **COVID-19** impact 🦠

--

- ### Challenge of replicating corporate operations remotely granting the importance of **face-to-face** interactions 🤝

--

- ### Distinct corporate institutional arrangements in Japan (**relational finance** & **stakeholder governance**) 💴 🏣

--

- ### Chance to re-create optimal **work-life balance** by combining office work and telework 💮

---

# RQ & Hypotheses

<ru-blockquote>What are the main factors affecting **productivity** and **job satisfaction** in an online environment?</ru-blockquote>

--
> **Hypothesis 1**
>
The perceived telework productivity is higher for .white.bg-black[individual] than for .white.bg-black[collective] tasks.

--

> **Hypothesis 2**
>
The perceived telework productivity is higher for .white.bg-black[simple] than for .white.bg-black[creative] tasks.

--

> **Hypothesis 3**
>
Managers and recipients of .white.bg-black[“seniority-merit”] wages are less productive in an online environment than, respectively, ordinary employees and recipients of .white.bg-black[“performance-based”] wages.

# Data & findings

.panelset.sideways[
.panel[.panel-name[**Sample features**]

- ### 500 employees (sourced via the marketing company)

- ### 41 out of 47 Japanese prefectures 🗾

- ### 300 males & 200 females

- ### 50% employed in SMEs (< 1000 workers); 50% — in large companies 
]

.panel[.panel-name[**Individual vs. collective & Simple vs. creative**]

knitr::include_graphics("assets/img/CombinedHist.png")
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[**Key takeaways**]

- ### online productivity is significantly lower for **collective** than for **individual** assignments

- ### employees under the **“seniority-merit”** wage system experience consistently lower levels of online productivity than recipients of **"performance-based"** wages for all types of assignments

- ### **managerial affiliation** ➡ **low group productivity**; high pre-COVID **sleeping hours** ➡ **low individual productivity** for both simple and creative tasks

# Why this research matters

- ### Non-regular employees have **weaker social protection** and are easy targets for corporate layoffs during crises 🎲

--

- ### **Shareholders' pressure** ➡ prioritizing short-term profits at the expense of employment security 💹

--

- ### Lower productivity of precarious labor ➡ negative impact on corporate sustainability 🥀

# RQ & Hypothesis

<ru-blockquote>What are the main features of income- and job-loss deprivations accruing within developing economies due to the impact of the the COVID-19 pandemic?</ru-blockquote>

--
> **Hypothesis**
>
Informally employed workers such as **“self-employed”** and **“temps”** have suffered higher magnitudes of income loss and job loss than formally employed workers.

.panel[.panel-name[**Findings**]

- #### **self-employed** are 25% more likely than regular workers to experience **income loss**

- #### **temporary employees** are 15% more likely than regular workers to experience **income loss** and 1% more likely — job loss

- #### **urban** residents are 1% more likely than rural to experience **income loss**

- #### **household heads** have 2% and 0.4% higher chances of losing, respectively, **income** and **job**, than respondents with other family roles

# Conclusions

--

> 
**1.** Institutional features associated with .white.bg-black[R&D spending] provide valuable signals for investors across multiple industries.
>

???

* Most of the companies, but especially the ones belonging to **Pharm** and **Chemical** industries are still embedded in a system of industrial coordination. Oligopolistic features still prevalent

--

> 
**2.** Quality of a patented output .white.bg-black[(Citations per Patent)] mostly matters for the manufacturing sector.
>

???

* Thereby these companies react to the accumulating competitive pressures and are redefining themselves within an open-market system

--

> 
**3.** Pronounced nonlinear trend in the market perception of .white.bg-black[corporate age]: only the more experienced companies receive market premium as they get older.
