Our findings, for the period from 1985 to 1997 indicate that insider gains in R\&D-intensive firms are substantially larger than insider gains in firms without R\&D. Insiders also take advantage of information on planned changes in R\&D budgets. R\&D is thus a major contributor to information asymmetry and insider gains, raising issues concerning management compensation, incentives, and disclosure policies.},

It is based on analysis of science and technology output indicators, namely patents and innovations evaluated in terms of originality and, in the case of innovations, in terms of market success as well. Radical innovation (RI) is identified as the kingpin for the evolution of technologies in both the micro- and macro-economic context, not only because it provides a model for imitation, but also because it turns out to be more profitable for the innovating companies than incremental innovation. At the micro-economic level, this paper examines the significance of diverse driving forces which lead a company to the launching of projects aiming at RI, measures the length of commitment to such projects, and describes the dynamic effects generated by the introduction of a successful RI, and how they affect the company's subsequent R\&D and market orientation. At the macro-economic level, this paper identifies the stages of youth, growth, maturity and decline of the subsectors of the chemical industry, examines the distribution of RI and market-successful innovations over the development of a sector, describes the influence of market demand and capital investment on technological advance, and compares the development of national chemical industries. The paper concludes with an account of the dynamics of technological innovation in the chemical industry over the period 1930\textendash 1985, which is based on the empirical findings of the previous sections.},

Next, using a dataset based on a survey of Italian manufacturing firms, we find that R\&D and IA increase the extensive and intensive margins of employing workers with temporary contracts. Moreover, we disentangle the impact of different types of R\&D and IA, finding that extra muros R\&D always has a positive effect, while the effect of intra muros R\&D is generally null. Also the effect of IA changes according to the type of activity: positive with product innovation, null with process innovation.},

The analysis of patent citation data reveals that small firms are tied into regional knowledge networks to a greater extent than large firms. These findings point to the role of entrepreneurial firms in the exploration of new technological spaces and in the diffusion of their accumulated knowledge through local small firm networks.},

Through an analysis of the video game industry, this article highlights its potential and limitations. The current hype of user-led innovation entails the risk of the concept's being over-applied in terms of its applicability across industries and assumption of benefits. We argue that user-led innovation emerged out of not only technology-specific environment, but also culturally-specific context of industries. Our analysis shows that user-led innovation in its applications is likely to be constrained by the cultural context among other obstacles, thereby limiting its usefulness to a set of industries with particular characteristics. .},

Equally important, according to these theories, is the logic of debt investment which is often at odds with the logic of equity investment.

  abstract = {Why does Japan have a large earnings gap between regular and non-regular employment? We attempt to answer this question through the lens of the legitimation of inequality, assuming the possibility that the inequality remains unresolved because it is legitimized due to institutional settings in Japanese society. In this paper, we explore to what extent the inequality is legitimized, as well as how it is legitimized, in Japanese society by analyzing data collected from a comparative vignette survey on the just income of fictitious workers in comparison with South Korea and the United States. The results of multilevel model analysis show that the income gap between regular and non-regular employees is accepted as just in Japan and South Korea. Moreover, non-regular worker respondents think that the income gap should be wider than regular worker respondents do (against their own interests) only in Japan. To some extent, the acceptance of income inequality and its over-acceptance by non-regular workers can be explained by the assumed difference in the duties and opportunities in the workplace between regular and non-regular employees, which is brought about by the male breadwinner model and Japanese firms' practices to secure the livelihood of employees and their families. Based on the results, we argue that the income inequality between regular and non-regular employment in Japan has a stronger logic of legitimation and, therefore, is more likely to persist than in other countries.},

In particular, focus is put on the effect played by the level of digitisation of newspapers and magazines, some of which have resisted digitisation, while others have embraced it. We find that greater levels of digitisation tend to increase the likelihood of job creation and reduce the probability of job destruction. Likewise, higher level of digitisation leads, on average, to higher earnings for journalists. At the same time, though, higher digitisation also increases sharply the likelihood that jobs created are of casual contractual natures, as opposed to regular permanent contracts. Yet, we find that digitisation also has a positive impact on the earnings of journalists on a casual contact (though, far less than for `tenured' journalists). More surprisingly, we show that digitisation also reduces job instability of those journalists on a casual contract, as a greater level of digitisation reduces the likelihood of job destruction, even for casual jobs. Though, while digitisation tends to change the contractual nature of job created, embracing digitisation appears to be a `lesser evil' than resisting technological change.},

However, the flexibility gained through temporary contracts hardly affects the core of permanent employees. Instead, temporary jobs result in the emergence of a dual labour market. Worse, it is conceivable that wage growth actually rises when wage setting is in the hands of permanent insider workers, as happens in many European countries. This possibility receives empirical support in a sample offive EC countries, especially in those where permanent employment is highly costly to adjust. Spain, which has gone furthest in promoting temporary employment, provides an interesting and worrisome picture of what to expect if two-tier labour markets become prevalent in Europe.},

The existence of non-constant elasticities is assessed, due to the combination of efficient scale and decreasing return to R\&D: in our empirical estimates the scale effect tends to prevail for a given R\&D intensity generating an increasing relation between total turnover and employment. These results have important implications for policymakers: innovation supporting policies should be correctly tailored and monitored since the results depend on the characteristics of the benefiting firms. Moreover, R\&D intensity on GDP should be managed with care if taken as a policy target, given that the denominator is endogenous and non-linearly dependent on research expenditure.},

We provide new insights into identifying, exploring and rationalizing the indigenous innovation ecosystems and unorthodox value-creating logic of BMs emerging from the Greater China territory. Moreover, whereas the COVID-19 crisis has fundamentally changed the way people do business along with the lockdowns followed by some forms of de-globalization; it is expected to see a new wave of BM evolution. We, thus, outline three promising and nascent pathways for future efforts departing from a cultural view to explore the value logic of BMs and BM innovation within the Asia-Pacific region in the post-COVID-19 era: (1) the role of culture in BM innovation; (2) new ways of creating the knowledge and managing knowledge iceberg phenomenon and (3) using the `Bottom of Pyramid' approach to BM innovation for incorporating social goals into value creation logic.},

A firm, on average, experiences only modest growth and may grow for a number of reasons that may or may not be related to innovative activity. However, given that the returns to innovation are highly skewed and that growth rates distributions are heavy-tailed, it may be misleading to use regression techniques that focus on the `average effect for the average firm'. Using a quantile regression approach, we observe that innovation is of crucial importance for a handful of `superstar' fast-growth firms.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the stock market's valuation of a firm's innovative activity. We estimate the market's relative valuation of firms' tangible and intangible assets, focusing on knowledge capital in the form of accumulated "stocks" of R\&D and patents. We tried to improve upon our estimates of the stock market's valuation of knowledge capital embodied in such "stocks" by bringing in measures of the appropriability environment facing a firm from the Yale Survey on Industrial Research and Development. The responses to Survey questions about the effectiveness of patents as a mechanism for protecting the returns from innovation turn out to be of some use: there is evidence of an interaction between industry level measures of the effectiveness of patents and the market's valuation of a firm's past R\&D and patenting performance, as well as its current R\&D moves. We find no evidence, however, that other appropriability mechanisms differ enough across industries to leave measurable traces in our data. The structure of the Yale Survey makes it possible to estimate the sampling error in the appropriability measures derived from it. This information was used by us in an errors-in-variables context, but with little success. In the absence of R\&D variables, our estimates imply that a two standard deviation increase in our index of patent effectiveness would raise the value of a patent held by our average firm from \$0.4 million to \$1.0 million. When R\&D variables are introduced into the equations, the patents variables become insignificant - R\&D expenditures are a better measure of input to the innovative function of firms than patents are of its output - but we estimate that the same experiment would induce changes in q of between 10 and 27 percent for the average firm, approximately doubling the market's valuation of this kind of capital.{$<$}br{$><$}small{$>$}(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.){$<$}/small{$>$}},

Yet, this essay argues that the factors leading to a resource-based advantage also predict who will appropriate rent. Knowledge-based assets are promising because firm-specificity, social complexity, and causal ambiguity make them hard to imitate. However, the roles of internal stakeholders may grant them a great deal of bargaining power especially relative to investors.This essay integrates the resource-based view with the bargaining power literature by defining the firm as a nexus of contracts. This new lens can help to explain when rent will be generated and, simultaneously, who will appropriate it. In doing so, it provides a more robust theory of firm performance than the resource-based view alone. It is also suggested that this lens might be useful for examining other theories of firm performance.},

Its thesis is that the organizational mode through which individuals cooperate affects the knowledge they apply to business activity. We focus on the polar cases of organization within a firm as compared to market contracting. There will be a difference in the knowledge that is brought to bear, and hence in joint productivity, under the two options. Thus, as compared to opportunism-based, transaction-cost theory, we advance a separate (yet complementary) answer to the question: why do firms exist? Our aim is to develop an empirically relevant and complementary theory of why firms are formed: a theory based on irreducible knowledge differences between individuals rather than the threat of purposeful cheating or withholding of information. We assume limited cognitive abilities on the part of individuals (bounded rationality), and assume that opportunistic behavior will not occur. The latter allows us to determine whether resource-based theory has independent force, as compared to the opportunism-based, transaction-cost approach. The paper predicts choice of organizational mode, identifying whether firm organization or market contracting will result in the more valuable knowledge being applied to business activity. The resource-based predictions of organizational mode are compared and contrasted with corresponding opportunism-based, transaction-cost ones. A principal point is that knowledge-based considerations can outweigh opportunism-related ones. The paper also establishes the relation of a theory of the firm to a theory of performance differences between competing firms.},

The conclusion is that measures based on R\&D, patents, and citation-weighted patents are each highly significant in a market value regression, although patent-based measures tend to be somewhat less significant in the presence of R\&D measures. According to the results, in most countries one dollar of additional R\&D spending adds slightly less than a dollar to market value; an alternative interpretation is that R\&D assets depreciate at a somewhat higher rate than 15 per cent per year.},

Together with employment-stimulating effects stemming from existing products, they overcompensate the negative displacement effects resulting in net employment growth in foreignowned firms.

We also show that there is no significant difference on the basis of gender. On the contrary, non-regular jobs (those that concern temporary and part-time workers) are more vulnerable to computer technology diffusion than the others.

Using insights from different research traditions, sound evidence is found for a positive relation between different forms of functional flexibility and both EDI and organizational innovation. This is nevertheless not so for contractual and financial flexibility. Indications are found that these types of labour flexibility are potentially negative for both EDI and organizational innovation. Yet, trends in the European labour market and EU backed policies do not focus on enhancing functional flexibility, but rather aim to increase contractual and financial flexibility.},

Many people in both those countries share the assumptions dominant today in Britain and America--that managers should be intent solely on creating shareholder value and that shareholders' financial logic alone should determine who buys what company on the stock exchange. That way efficiency (and hence global welfare) will be maximized.The Japanese and German advocates of full-bloodied market capitalism are not having it all their own way, however. In both countries there are articulate defenders of what they consider to be a better way of life, informed by a more human, more social-solidary, set of values. Dore traces the fascinating debates which ensue on corporate governance, on worker rights, on supplier relations, on cartels and anti-trust, on pensions and welfare. He alsoanalyses actual changes in economic behaviour-an essential means of sorting out a lot of the muddle and double-talk not just in the internal debates themselves, but even more in the foreign reporting of them.These accounts of the battle for the national soul in Japan and Germany constitute one of the finest contributions to the 'diversity of capitalism' debate. Dore's account should be read by anyone who is interested to know whether, for all the talk of globalization, that diversity is going to survive.},

Hence it could be that more ``flexible'' and ``fluid'' labour markets, while allowing for faster inter-firm reallocation of labour, may also render the whole economic system more fragile, more prone to recession, and more volatile. In this work, we investigate some conditions under which such a conjecture applies. The paper presents an agent-based model that investigates the effects of two ``archetypes of capitalism'' \textendash{} in terms of regimes of labour governance defined by the mechanisms of wage determination, firing, labour protection and productivity gains sharing \textendash{} upon (i) labour market regularities and (ii) macroeconomic dynamics (long-term rates of growth, GDP fluctuations, unemployment rates, inequality, etc.). The model is built upon the ``Keynes meets Schumpeter'' family of models (Dosi et~al., 2010), explicitly incorporating different microfounded labour market regimes. Our results show that seemingly more rigid labour markets and labour relations are conducive to coordination successes leading to higher and smoother growth.},

The empirical evidence presented shows that the ``direct'' impact of innovation on employment varies greatly according to the type of innovation strategy pursued by firms, across industries and according to the level of qualification of the labour force. High skilled and qualified jobs do replace low skilled jobs. Among small firms and in less than half of the service sectors considered the net effect is positive, particularly in industries which have a strong scientific and technological base. The negative impact of innovation on employment is on the contrary concentrated among large firms, capital intensive industries and in all financial-related sectors (banking, insurance and other financial services). In the latter industries the labour-saving effect of innovation seems to be linked to the widespread use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) which have contributed to rationalise and increase labour productivity in an important section of services. In the case of Italy, an overall negative impact of innovation on employment has been found. This result is clearly affected by the de-specialisation of the Italian economy in the knowledge intensive services. From an innovation-policy perspective two lines of actions can be envisaged: one enhancing efficiency in the technologically laggard service sectors and a second one aiming at creating the conditions for the emergence and growth of knowledge-intensive branches. The evidence presented suggests that both these lines of policy action are important but also that the second one is likely to be more rewarding in terms of employment growth.},

The United States can be considered the leading innovator among industrialized nations as measured by its net exports of knowledge-intensive goods. However, the R \& D trade balance, reflecting US export strength in technology-based manufactured goods, although increasing from 1960, has recently declined, while Japan has continued to increase its share of high-technology products. In this article factors are identified that affect the process of innovation within organizations and US and Japanese organizations are analyzed to clarify the contributing and inhibiting factors.

Alternatively, it tests an index that groups the stock markets of advanced economies to identify whether this driving force is international. Second, regarding co-movement with the US, the article explores whether its time-varying nature is contingent on the domestic and international economic policy regimes. I find evidence that there is a strong and contemporaneous co-movement between the US and UK stock markets. Additionally, through a VAR model, I identify that the movements in the UK stock market cause, in the Granger sense, changes in the index for advanced economies up to two years later. Furthermore, in the short-run co-movement between the US and UK stock markets is contingent on the macroeconomic trilemma while, in the long run, both domestic and international policy regimes affect the relationship. A final contribution is the design of a new methodology for describing the evolution of financial time series as risk-adjusted above or below average returns to different time horizons: the Local Bull Bear Indicators (LBBIs).},

We demonstrate that local government investments fail to coordinate with central government investments during the lost two decades, and such a coordination failure is a one-time phenomenon in nearly a half-century. In this period, local government investments exhibit no countercyclical behavior to business cycles, which is contributory to the ineffectiveness of fiscal stimulus that is pointed out by our predecessors.},

The resulting theory has implications for the basis of organizational capability, the principles of organization design (in particular, the analysis of hierarchy and the distribution of decision-making authority), and the determinants of the horizontal and vertical boundaries of the firm. More generally, the knowledge-based approach sheds new light upon current organizational innovations and trends and has far-reaching implications for management practice.},

We advance a configurational perspective that acknowledges the fit between stakeholder engagement, context, firm attributes and performance.

Analyzing a cross-national sample of firms from 2004 to 2011, we identify combinations of engagement strategies, firm attributes, and contexts linked to high performance. Our findings highlight the multiple context-dependent paths, which link stakeholder engagement to high firm performance. Managerial summary How do firms navigate pressures from shareholders and employees across different institutional environments? We develop a typology of stakeholder engagement strategies based on how firms in different countries strike a balance between conformity (i.e., prioritizing locally important stakeholders) and differentiation (i.e., prioritizing stakeholders that their local peers might neglect). Our findings show that the engagement strategies associated with high performance vary according to local institutional context and firm characteristics. In particular, by not merely prioritizing stakeholders who are already locally important, firms can use stakeholder engagement to differentiate themselves from their peers, and such engagement strategies are often linked to high performance.},

In this paper we take a first step towards filling this gap using a newly constructed panel dataset of firms which are publicly traded in France, Germany, and Italy. Controlling for either permanent unobserved firm effects or sample selection due to the voluntary nature of R\&D disclosure, we find that the relative shadow value of R\&D in France and Germany is remarkably similar both to each other and to that in the US or the UK during the same period. In contrast, we find that R\&D in publicly traded Italian firms is not valued by financial markets on average. However, when we control for the presence of a single large shareholder, we find that both French and Italian firms have high R\&D valuations when no single shareholder holds more than one third of the firm, but that R\&D is essentially not valued at all in the remaining firms.},

This paper develops an approach to institutional change more extended than the one provided in Hall and Soskice (in Varieties of Capitalism: The Institutional Foundations of Comparative Advantage, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2001) but congruent with its varieties-of-capitalism perspective. It begins by outlining an approach to institutional stability, which suggests that the persistence of institutions depends not only on their aggregate welfare effects but also on the distributive benefits that they provide to the underlying social or political coalitions; and not only on the Pareto-optimal quality of such equilibria but also on continuous processes of mobilization through which the actors test the limits of the existing institutions. It then develops an analysis of institutional change that emphasizes the ways in which defection, reinterpretation and reform emerge out of such contestation and assesses the accuracy of this account against recent developments in the political economies of Europe. The paper concludes by outlining the implications of this perspective for contemporary analyses of liberalization in the political economy.},

We use the firm's R\&D expenditures and the number of patents (in stock) as the measures of its technological assets and show that the relative usefulness of these two measures varies across industries. Particularly, Tobin's q is positively related to the technological assets most strongly in the pharmaceutical industry. It is also most sensitive in this industry to the level of patent stock, coinciding with the view that drug patents are more effective than other patents as a means of appropriating returns from innovation. The communications equipment industry is also characterized by its q's dependence.on patent stock. In addition, this industry's q is particularly sensitive to the level of net R\&D investment in the most recent year. presumably because of the rapid technological progress in this industry.},

Trend increases in productivity reinforced by process innovation are an important source of reduction of employment requirements for a given output, but the growth of demand for the old products tends to overcompensate these displacement effects. The switch of production towards new products does not reduce employment requirements, and the growth of the demand for the new products is the strongest force behind employment creation. Reallocation due to business stealing is estimated at a maximum of one third of the net employment created by product innovators. The growth of employment originated from the market expansion induced by the new products can be as important as another third.},

Next, analyzing the determinants of the R\&D intensity in 1998, we found that the shareholding ratios of large shareholders and the leverage ratios were positively correlated with R\&D intensity, while the proportion of bank loans to total debt was negatively correlated with it. These results are consistent with the hypotheses that stress the disciplinary roles of large shareholders and debt. It is also consistent with a bank's holdup hypothesis. Finally, comparing the results of 1998 with those of 1989, we found that the positive roles of keiretsu affiliation and cross-shareholdings disappeared during the last decade.},

The results also suggest that firms with superior refinement capability tend to possess superior reconfiguration capability. Our findings show that both external and internal factors, such as technological volatility, inter-firm collaboration, and firm age and size, are significantly associated with the level of refinement and reconfiguration capabilities possessed by a firm.},

Whereas Japan's video-game industry emerged out of corporate sponsorships in arcades, toys, and consumer electronics industries and drew skills from the comic book and animated-film sectors, the video-game industry in the United States evolved from arcades and personal computers. In the United Kingdom the video-game industry developed bottom-up, through a process of skills formation in the youth culture of `bedroom coders' that nurtured self-taught programmers in their teens throughout the country.},

  abstract = {How should we understand why firms exist? A prevailing view has been that they serve to keep in check the transaction costs arising from the self-interested motivations of individuals. We develop in this article the argument that what firms do better than markets is the sharing and transfer of the knowledge of individuals and groups within an organization. This knowledge consists of information (e.g., who knows what) and of know-how (e.g., how to organize a research team). What is central to our argument is that knowledge is held by individuals, but is also expressed in regularities by which members cooperate in a social community (i.e., group, organization, or network). If knowledge is only held at the individual level, then firms could change simply by employee turnover. Because we know that hiring new workers is not equivalent to changing the skills of a firm, an analysis of what firms can do must understand knowledge as embedded in the organizing principles by which people cooperate within organizations.Based on this discussion, a paradox is identified: efforts by a firm to grow by the replication of its technology enhances the potential for imitation. By considering how firms can deter imitation by innovation, we develop a more dynamic view of how firms create new knowledge. We build up this dynamic perspective by suggesting that firms learn new skills by recombining their current capabilities. Because new ways of cooperating cannot be easily acquired, growth occurs by building on the social relationships that currently exist in a firm. What a firm has done before tends to predict what it can do in the future. In this sense, the cumulative knowledge of the firm provides options to expand in new but uncertain markets in the future.We discuss at length the example of the make/buy decision and propose several testable hypotheses regarding the boundaries of the firm, without appealing to the notion of ``opportunism.''},

We present a conceptual framework assuming that organizational capabilities consist of multilayered knowledge. Based on the idea, we classify organizational capabilities into ``local,'' ``architectural,'' and ``process'' capabilities along two dimensions: modularity and designability. The empirical analysis demonstrates differential effects of different types of organizational capabilities on different types of product development performance, and compares the differential effects between two types of industries that differ in terms of their product characteristics: system based and material based. The central message from our analysis is that the process capabilities emerging from dynamic interaction of knowledge play a crucial role as core capabilities for product development of Japanese firms in the system-based industries in which Japanese firms are relatively competitive. In the material industries, however, local capabilities have major effects on performance while effects of process capabilities are limited, which underlies the relative weakness of Japanese firms in developing material-based products. Our results raise some intriguing implications on the competitive advantages and challenges of Japanese firms' product development.},

We describe the differences in laws and the effectiveness of their enforcement across countries, discuss the possible origins of these differences, summarize their consequences, and assess potential strategies of corporate governance reform.

We further show that collaborations are at the core of new industry formation, but that they possess distinct properties. As the emergence of this new industry matches to the characteristics of Japan's institutional and knowledge regime we essentially argue that the notion of regimes with fewer start-ups being inefficient is erroneous.

However, the last two decades, which can be regarded as the golden age of innovation, saw a gradual shift in ideology. There has been indeed growing doubt about the relevance of the dominant model of innovation. This introductory chapter's main goal is to analyze the conditions of a shift from a techno-centric society to a human-centric society, one where technology's potential for positive impact is not disregarded, but where social and human well-being is central to realize this potential. Another goal is to discuss non-technological aspects of innovation and their importance in dealing with complex contemporary societal issues, while also making a critical assessment of the relationship between science, technology, innovation (STI) and society.},

In contrast, this study focuses on multinational corporations and examines the extent to which country effects explain the variation in the performance of foreign affiliates.

The first represents a widening pattern: concentration of innovative activities is low, innovators are of small economic size, stability in the ranking of innovators is low and entry of new innovators is high. The second represents a deepening pattern: concentration of innovative activities is higher than in the first group, innovators are of larger economic size, stability in the ranking of innovators is greater, and entry is lower.

However, in the case of emerging economies, firms are more financially constrained, and they tend to suffer from weaker-management practices, which can be a drag on their performance despite greater innovation. Hence, whether better-managed firms benefit more effectively from innovation with greater access to finance remains unexplored. Using quarterly firm-level data during 1992\textendash 2015 from Turkey, this paper aims to uncover whether innovation intensity, in the traditional sense, namely R\&D and intangibles, and better managerial practices, in the modern form, contribute to the performance of Turkish firms. By considering the financial constraints before and after the 2008 global financial crisis and by undertaking an impact evaluation of improved accounting regulation relating to disclosure on management practices, we find that all types of innovation activities boost profitability. In addition, R\&D activities, with better management quality, help improve firm performance. Furthermore, although higher debt level, in general, is harmful, firms with better management quality make more effective use of innovative activities, along with higher financial leverage, in boosting their performance. Lastly, those better-managed firms in an emerging economy outperformed even during times of financial stress following the global financial crisis. The above findings survive a battery of robustness checks.},

The distinguishing feature that differentiates among organizational alternatives is the different way each resolves conflict over the selection of solution trials, that is, the way it chooses the path of search. Our theory predicts that efficiency demands that these governance alternatives be matched in a discriminating way to problems based on their associated benefits and costs in governing solution search. Thus, our theory is among the first to simultaneously treat both the boundary choice (i.e., internal versus external) and the choice among alternative internal approaches to organizing.},

In this paper, knowledge creation is conceptualized as a dialectical process, in which various contradictions are synthesized through dynamic interactions among individuals, the organization, and the environment. With the view of a firm as a dialectic being, and strategy and organization should be re-examined as the synthesizing and self-transcending process instead of a logical analysis of structure or action.

We conduct an online survey in two countries\textemdash United States, and Japan, then compare the result with the previous research in the United Kingdom. As a result, we found a significant number of consumers creating their own products or modifying existing products in all three countries, and that a substantial amount of money and time was invested in this. However, only an extremely small number of product innovations were adopted by enterprises as potential products. For manufacturers, we suggest that they should regard users' creative activities and collaborate more with users, especially in a community level; or they may take effort in working with creative consumers. For policymakers or organizations concerned, it is significant that similar surveys should be conducted in both developed and developing countries in order to understand consumers' activities and abilities better.

By using the number of successful patents as research performance measure, we find significant returns to scope in drug discovery research. We also find nearly constant returns to scale at the individual therapeutic level. These findings suggest that Japanese pharmaceutical firms are relatively small in terms of research scope, regardless of firm size per se. The Japanese firms may be able to enlarge the scope of research without suffering from marginal productivity decline at the firm level. Concerning knowledge spillovers, we find positive correlation between domestic competitors' research spending and individual firm's patenting. But we detect negative correlation between research expenditures of large western pharmaceutical firms and the Japanese firms' patenting. This suggests that appropriation mechanism of patent may be very effective in drug discovery research, and may predominate over probable knowledge spillovers among pharmaceutical firms especially in globally patented drug discovery research.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a new method is proposed for estimating the depreciation rate of technological knowledge based on the analysis of technology cycle time (TCT). Patent citation data are used in an empirical analysis. The following features characterize the proposed TCT-based method: i) Estimation of the depreciation rate is measured by using the entire set of patents; and ii) The current approach generates the sector-specific depreciation rates for individual industrial sectors. Overall, the results of empirical analysis are in accordance with expectation. The average depreciation rate (13.3 \%) is rather higher than other estimates of previous research. At the same time, consistent upward trends are found over time. Regarding the sectoral variation among industries, emerging and high-tech sectors show faster pace of technical progress but at the same time higher rate of technical obsolescence, vis-\`a-vis traditional manufacturing sectors or light industries.},

The hierarchical GAM (HGAM), allows modeling of nonlinear functional relationships between covariates and outcomes where the shape of the function itself varies between different grouping levels. We describe the theoretical connection between HGAMs, HGLMs, and GAMs, explain how to model different assumptions about the degree of intergroup variability in functional response, and show how HGAMs can be readily fitted using existing GAM software, the mgcv package in R. We also discuss computational and statistical issues with fitting these models, and demonstrate how to fit HGAMs on example data.

Why are there such differences? We theorize that the impact of family ownership and control on firm value is associated with the level of shareholder protection embodied in legal and regulatory institutions of a country. Data from 634 publicly listed large family firms in seven Asian countries (Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand) are used to test our hypotheses. Overall, this article sketches the contours of a cross-country, institution-based view of corporate governance, and leads to a more informed understanding of the crucial role of institutions behind family ownership and control in large firms.},

Although firms conduct international R\&D to tap into knowledge bases that reside in foreign countries, we argue that in order to benefit from international R\&D investments firms must already possess research capabilities in underlying or complementary technologies. We examine the international R\&D expansion activities, research capabilities, and patent output of 65 Japanese pharmaceutical firms from 1980 to 1991. We find that firms benefit from international R\&D only when they possess existing research capabilities in the underlying technologies. In addition to refining our understanding of when international R\&D enhances firm innovation, our results integrate asset-seeking and asset-based theories of foreign direct investment. Internationalizing R\&D to tap into foreign knowledge bases is consistent with asset-seeking theories of foreign direct investment, while the contingent nature by which firms benefit from international R\&D is consistent with asset-based theories of foreign direct investment and the notion of absorptive capacity.

In Study 2, results obtained from 4271 companies indicated that internal labour flexibility practices were positively related to product innovation and labour productivity. Findings suggest that internal labour flexibility practices benefit both labour productivity and innovation performance of companies.

Yet, we remain unsure about what impact this digitalization will have upon socio-economic institutions, how the introduction of this digitalization will be contested, the likely role of the state in managing the adoption of digital technology, and the likely consequences for the broader political economy if and when it is introduced. This article examines the process of digitalization as it has unfolded in the service sector in Japan. Based on qualitative interviews with managers in the hospitality industry and union officials, the paper depicts a process that contrasts starkly with the more optimistic view adopted by some commentators, according to which digitalization has the potential to improve working conditions and contribute to a more stable form of growth. Instead, the paper draws on Regulation Theory to argue that the introduction of digitalization is part of a wider process of neoliberalization. As such, digitalization has contributed to deskilling, the fragmentation of work tasks, a digital divide, the intensification of work, and higher levels of workplace surveillance. This represents a further dismantling of the social compromise that underpinned Japan's earlier period of economic growth.},

  abstract = {Background It is long known within the mathematical literature that the coefficient of determination R2 is an inadequate measure for the goodness of fit in nonlinear models. Nevertheless, it is still frequently used within pharmacological and biochemical literature for the analysis and interpretation of nonlinear fitting to data. Results The intensive simulation approach undermines previous observations and emphasizes the extremely low performance of R2 as a basis for model validity and performance when applied to pharmacological/biochemical nonlinear data. In fact, with the 'true' model having up to 500 times more strength of evidence based on Akaike weights, this was only reflected in the third to fifth decimal place of R2. In addition, even the bias-corrected R2adj exhibited an extreme bias to higher parametrized models. The bias-corrected AICc and also BIC performed significantly better in this respect. Conclusion Researchers and reviewers should be aware that R2 is inappropriate when used for demonstrating the performance or validity of a certain nonlinear model. It should ideally be removed from scientific literature dealing with nonlinear model fitting or at least be supplemented with other methods such as AIC or BIC or used in context to other models in question.},

Realized diffusion patterns are discussed and theoretical underpinnings of the diffusion process explored. Econometric models, data availability, and estimation are also considered although there is little attempt to be comprehensive re the latter given existing surveys. Diffusion policy is also addressed and some comments on future research directions offered.},

However, this view ignores two core findings of the economic systems literature: first, that mobility patterns are institutional microsystems that need to be complementary to other institutions in the labour market; and second, that new industries may be characterised by incremental and complex innovation. Based on these considerations, we ask how mobility affects innovation in the video games industry in the US and Japan. We find that inter-firm mobility is beneficial for innovation in the US, but has negative effects in Japan. We further find that inter-functional mobility is beneficial for innovation in both countries. Our analysis is based on career histories from the video games industry in the US and Japan. We present an empirical study based on the game development of 815 video games and the careers of 28,426 video game developers who were involved in the development of games released between 1999 and 2009.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the notion that national industrial models evolve with time, and provides evidence of transformation when elements are transferred from one society to another. The Japanese Production System, itself an adaptation of American-style mass production to the constraints of the post World War Two Japanese economy, in turn had a profound impact on the organization of industrial production in the United States, especially during the 1990s. I characterize the new model that emerged in the United States as the ``Modular Production System.'' This paper examines the response of Japanese electronics firms to Modular Production in the period 2000-2004. It is based on forty-three interviews with top managers at Japan's largest electronics firms, conducted during the calendar years 1999-2004, as well as insights gained from more than 600 field interviews conducted between 1999 and 2005 for the MIT Industrial Performance Center's Globalization Study. I argue that Japanese electronics firms have been strongly influenced by Modular Production but that they have, unsurprisingly, adapted it to their current environment and in the process may have begun to transform both the Japanese and Modular Production Systems. While it is too early to determine if these changes amount to the emergence of a distinct industrial model, the chapter concludes by laying out the challenges and opportunities that now face Japanese electronics firms given their recent experiments with joint technology development, production alliances, and global outsourcing.},

The results demonstrate that the relationship strongly depends on the type of innovation as well as the predominant innovation regime in which a company operates. Thereby, labour market flexibility does not influence innovation in an entrepreneurial innovation regime characterised by high competition, low market entry barriers and generally available knowledge. That might explain why the Silicon Valley has been successful despite of having a labour market with a strong strong hire and fire mentality. In contrast, labour market flexibility significantly reduces the likelihood of innovation in a routinised innovation regime with leading innovators and high entry barriers similar to the US automobile industry and steel districts that did not succeed. These findings emphasise that the currently discussed structural labour market reforms might hamper innovation as technological change still requires a level of security and stability.},

  abstract = {This study investigates how Japanese MNEs are adapting their ownership choices to accommodate China's economic liberalization. Drawing upon the institution-based view of the firm, we propose an institutional response model that is simultaneously based on the progress of economic liberalization and the accumulation of subsidiary experience. This model suggests that Japanese MNEs increasingly adopt higher ownership levels in their subsidiaries because of the combined effects of deepening deregulation on foreign investments, declining pure uncertainty, and increasing contingent uncertainty during economic liberalization. It also suggests that the progress of economic liberalization continuously changes the combination of the two types of institutional uncertainty (pure and contingent), contextualizing the influence of subsidiary experience on Japanese MNEs' ownership choices. Using data for Japanese investments in China between 1991 and 2013, we construct a latent growth-curve model to provide empirical evidence for the proposed institutional response model.},

  abstract = {This study examines the impact of innovation strategies on employment growth in three Latin American countries (Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay) using microdata for manufacturing firms from innovation surveys. Building on the model proposed by Harrison et al. (2008), we relate employment to three innovation strategies: ``make only'' (R\&D), ``buy only'' (external R\&D, licensing of patents and know-how, technical assistance, and other external innovation activities) and ``make and buy'' (mixed strategy). Firms that conduct in-house innovation activities (``make only'') have the greatest impact on employment; the ``make and buy'' strategy comes in second. Similar results are found for small firms. These results highlight the importance of fostering in-house technological efforts not only for innovation per se, but also to promote growth in firm employment. The impact of ``make only'' strategies is greater in high-tech industries, whereas ``make only'' and ``make and buy'' have a similar impact on employment in low-tech industries. Finally, the study provides evidence of the mechanisms through which innovation strategies affect employment. The findings show that innovation strategies enhance technological innovation, but their impact differs between product and process innovation. Product innovation is mainly motivated by inhouse technology investments, followed by mixed strategies, whereas process innovation is basically driven by ``buy'' strategies.},
