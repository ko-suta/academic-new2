**Aim**. To examine workers' productivity and well-being in an online environment depending on types of work, remuneration systems, employment types and other socio-economic factors.


**Research questions**:

1. How has employees' productivity changed due to the transition from a face-to-face to an online environment depending on a type of assignment (individual vs. group \& simple vs. creative)?

2. Which employee cohorts have experienced largest impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of income- and job loss?


**Relevance**:
- While the existing scholarship pays attention to telework productivity in general, few studies distinguish between types of assignments (simple vs. creative) as well as work formats (individual vs. collective).
- Extending the analysis to the emerging economies and (i) identifying crisis-inflicted perils associated with urban residency, especially for temporary employees, (ii) demonstrating the challenges that exist for breadwinners in the context of a community-oriented society and (iii) assessing the impact of mobility and teleworking on the socioeconomic resilience.
