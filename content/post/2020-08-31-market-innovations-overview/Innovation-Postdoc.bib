Our findings, for the period from 1985 to 1997 indicate that insider gains in R\&D-intensive firms are substantially larger than insider gains in firms without R\&D. Insiders also take advantage of information on planned changes in R\&D budgets. R\&D is thus a major contributor to information asymmetry and insider gains, raising issues concerning management compensation, incentives, and disclosure policies.},

Next, using a dataset based on a survey of Italian manufacturing firms, we find that R\&D and IA increase the extensive and intensive margins of employing workers with temporary contracts. Moreover, we disentangle the impact of different types of R\&D and IA, finding that extra muros R\&D always has a positive effect, while the effect of intra muros R\&D is generally null. Also the effect of IA changes according to the type of activity: positive with product innovation, null with process innovation.},

Particularly, from the viewpoint of firms making consumer goods, it remains unclear whether they can take advantage of peer-to-peer interaction and collaboration among consumers in the Internet era. Through an analysis of the video game industry, this article highlights its potential and limitations. The current hype of user-led innovation entails the risk of the concept's being over-applied in terms of its applicability across industries and assumption of benefits. We argue that user-led innovation emerged out of not only technology-specific environment, but also culturally-specific context of industries. Our analysis shows that user-led innovation in its applications is likely to be constrained by the cultural context among other obstacles, thereby limiting its usefulness to a set of industries with particular characteristics. .},

Equally important, according to these theories, is the logic of debt investment which is often at odds with the logic of equity investment. This article demonstrates that overlooked influential actors in the field of corporate finance that subscribe to this logic of debt investment, i.e. bond rating agencies, are actively discouraging the spread of shareholder valuedriven corporate practices via the bond rating process. This is important given the shift to bond financing as the primary form of corporate finance in the USA.},

  abstract = {Why does Japan have a large earnings gap between regular and non-regular employment? We attempt to answer this question through the lens of the legitimation of inequality, assuming the possibility that the inequality remains unresolved because it is legitimized due to institutional settings in Japanese society. In this paper, we explore to what extent the inequality is legitimized, as well as how it is legitimized, in Japanese society by analyzing data collected from a comparative vignette survey on the just income of fictitious workers in comparison with South Korea and the United States. The results of multilevel model analysis show that the income gap between regular and non-regular employees is accepted as just in Japan and South Korea. Moreover, non-regular worker respondents think that the income gap should be wider than regular worker respondents do (against their own interests) only in Japan. To some extent, the acceptance of income inequality and its over-acceptance by non-regular workers can be explained by the assumed difference in the duties and opportunities in the workplace between regular and non-regular employees, which is brought about by the male breadwinner model and Japanese firms' practices to secure the livelihood of employees and their families. Based on the results, we argue that the income inequality between regular and non-regular employment in Japan has a stronger logic of legitimation and, therefore, is more likely to persist than in other countries.},

In particular, focus is put on the effect played by the level of digitisation of newspapers and magazines, some of which have resisted digitisation, while others have embraced it. We find that greater levels of digitisation tend to increase the likelihood of job creation and reduce the probability of job destruction. Likewise, higher level of digitisation leads, on average, to higher earnings for journalists. At the same time, though, higher digitisation also increases sharply the likelihood that jobs created are of casual contractual natures, as opposed to regular permanent contracts. Yet, we find that digitisation also has a positive impact on the earnings of journalists on a casual contact (though, far less than for `tenured' journalists). More surprisingly, we show that digitisation also reduces job instability of those journalists on a casual contract, as a greater level of digitisation reduces the likelihood of job destruction, even for casual jobs. Though, while digitisation tends to change the contractual nature of job created, embracing digitisation appears to be a `lesser evil' than resisting technological change.},

However, the flexibility gained through temporary contracts hardly affects the core of permanent employees. Instead, temporary jobs result in the emergence of a dual labour market. Worse, it is conceivable that wage growth actually rises when wage setting is in the hands of permanent insider workers, as happens in many European countries. This possibility receives empirical support in a sample offive EC countries, especially in those where permanent employment is highly costly to adjust. Spain, which has gone furthest in promoting temporary employment, provides an interesting and worrisome picture of what to expect if two-tier labour markets become prevalent in Europe.},

The existence of non-constant elasticities is assessed, due to the combination of efficient scale and decreasing return to R\&D: in our empirical estimates the scale effect tends to prevail for a given R\&D intensity generating an increasing relation between total turnover and employment. These results have important implications for policymakers: innovation supporting policies should be correctly tailored and monitored since the results depend on the characteristics of the benefiting firms. Moreover, R\&D intensity on GDP should be managed with care if taken as a policy target, given that the denominator is endogenous and non-linearly dependent on research expenditure.},

The same holds for firms which directed their R\&D towards information technology. Smaller firms have, ceteris paribus, substantially higher growth rates of employment than their larger counterparts. Against our expectations, R\&D cooperation has no significant impact on employment growth. The same holds for activities in the fields of biotechnology and new materials.},

We estimate the market's relative valuation of firms' tangible and intangible assets, focusing on knowledge capital in the form of accumulated "stocks" of R\&D and patents. We tried to improve upon our estimates of the stock market's valuation of knowledge capital embodied in such "stocks" by bringing in measures of the appropriability environment facing a firm from the Yale Survey on Industrial Research and Development. The responses to Survey questions about the effectiveness of patents as a mechanism for protecting the returns from innovation turn out to be of some use: there is evidence of an interaction between industry level measures of the effectiveness of patents and the market's valuation of a firm's past R\&D and patenting performance, as well as its current R\&D moves. We find no evidence, however, that other appropriability mechanisms differ enough across industries to leave measurable traces in our data. The structure of the Yale Survey makes it possible to estimate the sampling error in the appropriability measures derived from it. This information was used by us in an errors-in-variables context, but with little success. In the absence of R\&D variables, our estimates imply that a two standard deviation increase in our index of patent effectiveness would raise the value of a patent held by our average firm from \$0.4 million to \$1.0 million. When R\&D variables are introduced into the equations, the patents variables become insignificant - R\&D expenditures are a better measure of input to the innovative function of firms than patents are of its output - but we estimate that the same experiment would induce changes in q of between 10 and 27 percent for the average firm, approximately doubling the market's valuation of this kind of capital.{$<$}br{$><$}small{$>$}(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.){$<$}/small{$>$}},

The conclusion is that measures based on R\&D, patents, and citation-weighted patents are each highly significant in a market value regression, although patent-based measures tend to be somewhat less significant in the presence of R\&D measures. According to the results, in most countries one dollar of additional R\&D spending adds slightly less than a dollar to market value; an alternative interpretation is that R\&D assets depreciate at a somewhat higher rate than 15 per cent per year.},

On the contrary, non-regular jobs (those that concern temporary and part-time workers) are more vulnerable to computer technology diffusion than the others.

Using insights from different research traditions, sound evidence is found for a positive relation between different forms of functional flexibility and both EDI and organizational innovation. This is nevertheless not so for contractual and financial flexibility. Indications are found that these types of labour flexibility are potentially negative for both EDI and organizational innovation. Yet, trends in the European labour market and EU backed policies do not focus on enhancing functional flexibility, but rather aim to increase contractual and financial flexibility.},

The empirical evidence presented shows that the ``direct'' impact of innovation on employment varies greatly according to the type of innovation strategy pursued by firms, across industries and according to the level of qualification of the labour force. High skilled and qualified jobs do replace low skilled jobs. Among small firms and in less than half of the service sectors considered the net effect is positive, particularly in industries which have a strong scientific and technological base. The negative impact of innovation on employment is on the contrary concentrated among large firms, capital intensive industries and in all financial-related sectors (banking, insurance and other financial services). In the latter industries the labour-saving effect of innovation seems to be linked to the widespread use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) which have contributed to rationalise and increase labour productivity in an important section of services. In the case of Italy, an overall negative impact of innovation on employment has been found. This result is clearly affected by the de-specialisation of the Italian economy in the knowledge intensive services. From an innovation-policy perspective two lines of actions can be envisaged: one enhancing efficiency in the technologically laggard service sectors and a second one aiming at creating the conditions for the emergence and growth of knowledge-intensive branches. The evidence presented suggests that both these lines of policy action are important but also that the second one is likely to be more rewarding in terms of employment growth.},

Second, regarding co-movement with the US, the article explores whether its time-varying nature is contingent on the domestic and international economic policy regimes. I find evidence that there is a strong and contemporaneous co-movement between the US and UK stock markets. Additionally, through a VAR model, I identify that the movements in the UK stock market cause, in the Granger sense, changes in the index for advanced economies up to two years later. Furthermore, in the short-run co-movement between the US and UK stock markets is contingent on the macroeconomic trilemma while, in the long run, both domestic and international policy regimes affect the relationship. A final contribution is the design of a new methodology for describing the evolution of financial time series as risk-adjusted above or below average returns to different time horizons: the Local Bull Bear Indicators (LBBIs).},

After distinguishing between public investment by the central government and that by local governments, this paper utilizes wavelet techniques to examine macroeconomic policy coordination between Japanese central and local governments. We demonstrate that local government investments fail to coordinate with central government investments during the lost two decades, and such a coordination failure is a one-time phenomenon in nearly a half-century. In this period, local government investments exhibit no countercyclical behavior to business cycles, which is contributory to the ineffectiveness of fiscal stimulus that is pointed out by our predecessors.},

We advance a configurational perspective that acknowledges the fit between stakeholder engagement, context, firm attributes and performance. As a cornerstone of this perspective, we develop a typology of stakeholder engagement strategies expressing how firms navigate the tension between conforming with local expectations\textemdash by prioritizing shareholders or employees, according to context\textemdash and being distinctive\textemdash by diverging from their peers. Analyzing a cross-national sample of firms from 2004 to 2011, we identify combinations of engagement strategies, firm attributes, and contexts linked to high performance. Our findings highlight the multiple context-dependent paths, which link stakeholder engagement to high firm performance. Managerial summary How do firms navigate pressures from shareholders and employees across different institutional environments? We develop a typology of stakeholder engagement strategies based on how firms in different countries strike a balance between conformity (i.e., prioritizing locally important stakeholders) and differentiation (i.e., prioritizing stakeholders that their local peers might neglect). Our findings show that the engagement strategies associated with high performance vary according to local institutional context and firm characteristics. In particular, by not merely prioritizing stakeholders who are already locally important, firms can use stakeholder engagement to differentiate themselves from their peers, and such engagement strategies are often linked to high performance.},

Using a new and comprehensive dataset containing over 4800 U. S.

We find that citation-weighted patent stocks are more highly correlated with market value than patent stocks themselves and that this fact is due mainly to the high valuation placed on firms that hold very highly cited patents.},

However, there have been no investigations for the continental countries in the European Union, in part because the analysis is complicated by data availability problems. In this paper we take a first step towards filling this gap using a newly constructed panel dataset of firms which are publicly traded in France, Germany, and Italy. Controlling for either permanent unobserved firm effects or sample selection due to the voluntary nature of R\&D disclosure, we find that the relative shadow value of R\&D in France and Germany is remarkably similar both to each other and to that in the US or the UK during the same period. In contrast, we find that R\&D in publicly traded Italian firms is not valued by financial markets on average. However, when we control for the presence of a single large shareholder, we find that both French and Italian firms have high R\&D valuations when no single shareholder holds more than one third of the firm, but that R\&D is essentially not valued at all in the remaining firms.},

Particularly, Tobin's q is positively related to the technological assets most strongly in the pharmaceutical industry. It is also most sensitive in this industry to the level of patent stock, coinciding with the view that drug patents are more effective than other patents as a means of appropriating returns from innovation. The communications equipment industry is also characterized by its q's dependence.on patent stock. In addition, this industry's q is particularly sensitive to the level of net R\&D investment in the most recent year. presumably because of the rapid technological progress in this industry.},

Trend increases in productivity reinforced by process innovation are an important source of reduction of employment requirements for a given output, but the growth of demand for the old products tends to overcompensate these displacement effects. The switch of production towards new products does not reduce employment requirements, and the growth of the demand for the new products is the strongest force behind employment creation. Reallocation due to business stealing is estimated at a maximum of one third of the net employment created by product innovators. The growth of employment originated from the market expansion induced by the new products can be as important as another third.},

Next, analyzing the determinants of the R\&D intensity in 1998, we found that the shareholding ratios of large shareholders and the leverage ratios were positively correlated with R\&D intensity, while the proportion of bank loans to total debt was negatively correlated with it. These results are consistent with the hypotheses that stress the disciplinary roles of large shareholders and debt. It is also consistent with a bank's holdup hypothesis. Finally, comparing the results of 1998 with those of 1989, we found that the positive roles of keiretsu affiliation and cross-shareholdings disappeared during the last decade.},

We argue that the cross-sectoral transfer of skills occurs differently depending on national contexts, such as the social legitimacy and strength of preexisting industries, the socioeconomic status of entrepreneurs or pioneer firms in an emerging industry, and the sociocultural cohesiveness between the preexisting and emerging industries. Each country draws on a different set of creative resources, which results in a unique trajectory. Whereas Japan's video-game industry emerged out of corporate sponsorships in arcades, toys, and consumer electronics industries and drew skills from the comic book and animated-film sectors, the video-game industry in the United States evolved from arcades and personal computers. In the United Kingdom the video-game industry developed bottom-up, through a process of skills formation in the youth culture of `bedroom coders' that nurtured self-taught programmers in their teens throughout the country.},

Here, numerical labor flexibility is defined as the external labor turnover of regular employees and the proportion of non-regular employees, and innovation outcomes include product innovation and patent applications. The estimation results of a random-effects probit model indicate that an inverted U-shaped relationship exists between the external labor turnover of regular employees and the probability of patent applications. Moreover, a similar U-shaped relationship exists between the proportion of non-regular employees and the probability of product innovation. These results are interpreted in light of the organizational characteristics of start-up firms. The implications of the findings are discussed.},

We present a conceptual framework assuming that organizational capabilities consist of multilayered knowledge. Based on the idea, we classify organizational capabilities into ``local,'' ``architectural,'' and ``process'' capabilities along two dimensions: modularity and designability. The empirical analysis demonstrates differential effects of different types of organizational capabilities on different types of product development performance, and compares the differential effects between two types of industries that differ in terms of their product characteristics: system based and material based. The central message from our analysis is that the process capabilities emerging from dynamic interaction of knowledge play a crucial role as core capabilities for product development of Japanese firms in the system-based industries in which Japanese firms are relatively competitive. In the material industries, however, local capabilities have major effects on performance while effects of process capabilities are limited, which underlies the relative weakness of Japanese firms in developing material-based products. Our results raise some intriguing implications on the competitive advantages and challenges of Japanese firms' product development.},

The dominant view is that, in the context of globalization, and the accompanying rise of international competition, OECD countries have a choice between two options: innovate or perish. However, the last two decades, which can be regarded as the golden age of innovation, saw a gradual shift in ideology. There has been indeed growing doubt about the relevance of the dominant model of innovation. This introductory chapter's main goal is to analyze the conditions of a shift from a techno-centric society to a human-centric society, one where technology's potential for positive impact is not disregarded, but where social and human well-being is central to realize this potential. Another goal is to discuss non-technological aspects of innovation and their importance in dealing with complex contemporary societal issues, while also making a critical assessment of the relationship between science, technology, innovation (STI) and society.},

Within each industry, firms pursue different R\&D strategies: firms that emphasize basic research absorb more basic scientific knowledge than those that emphasize applied research. These findings suggest that future research must carefully consider how industry context and the composition of R\&D mediate the relationship between research and innovation.},

We conduct an online survey in two countries\textemdash United States, and Japan, then compare the result with the previous research in the United Kingdom. As a result, we found a significant number of consumers creating their own products or modifying existing products in all three countries, and that a substantial amount of money and time was invested in this. However, only an extremely small number of product innovations were adopted by enterprises as potential products. For manufacturers, we suggest that they should regard users' creative activities and collaborate more with users, especially in a community level; or they may take effort in working with creative consumers. For policymakers or organizations concerned, it is significant that similar surveys should be conducted in both developed and developing countries in order to understand consumers' activities and abilities better.

By using the number of successful patents as research performance measure, we find significant returns to scope in drug discovery research. We also find nearly constant returns to scale at the individual therapeutic level. These findings suggest that Japanese pharmaceutical firms are relatively small in terms of research scope, regardless of firm size per se. The Japanese firms may be able to enlarge the scope of research without suffering from marginal productivity decline at the firm level. Concerning knowledge spillovers, we find positive correlation between domestic competitors' research spending and individual firm's patenting. But we detect negative correlation between research expenditures of large western pharmaceutical firms and the Japanese firms' patenting. This suggests that appropriation mechanism of patent may be very effective in drug discovery research, and may predominate over probable knowledge spillovers among pharmaceutical firms especially in globally patented drug discovery research.},

Overall, the results of empirical analysis are in accordance with expectation. The average depreciation rate (13.3 \%) is rather higher than other estimates of previous research. At the same time, consistent upward trends are found over time. Regarding the sectoral variation among industries, emerging and high-tech sectors show faster pace of technical progress but at the same time higher rate of technical obsolescence, vis-\`a-vis traditional manufacturing sectors or light industries.},

We describe the theoretical connection between HGAMs, HGLMs, and GAMs, explain how to model different assumptions about the degree of intergroup variability in functional response, and show how HGAMs can be readily fitted using existing GAM software, the mgcv package in R. We also discuss computational and statistical issues with fitting these models, and demonstrate how to fit HGAMs on example data.

In Study 2, results obtained from 4271 companies indicated that internal labour flexibility practices were positively related to product innovation and labour productivity. Findings suggest that internal labour flexibility practices benefit both labour productivity and innovation performance of companies. If innovation and labour productivity are considered key to long-term survival, firms and policymakers should consider internal labour flexibility practices.},

The data for OECD countries collected from stats.oecd. org for 2000 to 2010 is analyzed using Cognos. Results show that countries with low GDP rely on foreign collaboration for innovation; education enrollment stimulates innovation; among the sectors, government and higher education have higher R\&D expenditures than private and non-profit sectors. A significant contribution of our research lies in the dimension of internationalization and ownership of technology innovation.

  abstract = {Background
It is long known within the mathematical literature that the coefficient of determination R2 is an inadequate measure for the goodness of fit in nonlinear models. Nevertheless, it is still frequently used within pharmacological and biochemical literature for the analysis and interpretation of nonlinear fitting to data.

Results
The intensive simulation approach undermines previous observations and emphasizes the extremely low performance of R2 as a basis for model validity and performance when applied to pharmacological/biochemical nonlinear data. In fact, with the 'true' model having up to 500 times more strength of evidence based on Akaike weights, this was only reflected in the third to fifth decimal place of R2. In addition, even the bias-corrected R2adj exhibited an extreme bias to higher parametrized models. The bias-corrected AICc and also BIC performed significantly better in this respect.

Conclusion
Researchers and reviewers should be aware that R2 is inappropriate when used for demonstrating the performance or validity of a certain nonlinear model. It should ideally be removed from scientific literature dealing with nonlinear model fitting or at least be supplemented with other methods such as AIC or BIC or used in context to other models in question.},

However, this view ignores two core findings of the economic systems literature: first, that mobility patterns are institutional microsystems that need to be complementary to other institutions in the labour market; and second, that new industries may be characterised by incremental and complex innovation. Based on these considerations, we ask how mobility affects innovation in the video games industry in the US and Japan. We find that inter-firm mobility is beneficial for innovation in the US, but has negative effects in Japan. We further find that inter-functional mobility is beneficial for innovation in both countries. Our analysis is based on career histories from the video games industry in the US and Japan. We present an empirical study based on the game development of 815 video games and the careers of 28,426 video game developers who were involved in the development of games released between 1999 and 2009.},

More specifically, drawing upon a sample of 143 Greek ventures less than 8 years old, it examines empirically the individual and interactive effects of functional and numerical flexibility on product innovation. It also considers how these effects are moderated by the entrepreneur's political skill. Results suggest that functional flexibility has a positive direct effect on incremental innovation, whereas numerical flexibility has a positive direct effect on radical innovation. The interactions between numerical and functional flexibility affect both types of innovation. The results also suggest that the labor flexibility\textendash innovation relationship is positively moderated by the entrepreneur's political skill. These findings point toward aspects of knowledge related with flexible labor engagement and entrepreneurial relational capital that affect innovation.},

The results demonstrate that the relationship strongly depends on the type of innovation as well as the predominant innovation regime in which a company operates. Thereby, labour market flexibility does not influence innovation in an entrepreneurial innovation regime characterised by high competition, low market entry barriers and generally available knowledge. That might explain why the Silicon Valley has been successful despite of having a labour market with a strong strong hire and fire mentality. In contrast, labour market flexibility significantly reduces the likelihood of innovation in a routinised innovation regime with leading innovators and high entry barriers similar to the US automobile industry and steel districts that did not succeed. These findings emphasise that the currently discussed structural labour market reforms might hamper innovation as technological change still requires a level of security and stability.},

Both input (R \& D expenditure) and output (patent application number and patent quality) aspects of innovations are examined. The empirical results indicate that deregulation and market competition decrease the former, but increase the latter. These results are followed by a discussion on why this scenario occurs. The results also suggest that, after deregulation, utilities focus more on short-term, business-oriented R \& D projects. Hence, we call for governments to support long-term, public-oriented, and environmental research in the electric sector.},

Shareholder protection further enhances the growth of firms in R\&D intensive industries, and promotes the economic growth of innovative countries. The results consistently show that enforcing stronger legal shareholder protection can help firms achieve an overall more efficient capital allocation to productive R\&D investment.},

  abstract = {This study examines the impact of innovation strategies on employment growth in three Latin American countries (Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay) using microdata for manufacturing firms from innovation surveys. Building on the model proposed by Harrison et al. (2008), we relate employment to three innovation strategies: ``make only'' (R\&D), ``buy only'' (external R\&D, licensing of patents and know-how, technical assistance, and other external innovation activities) and ``make and buy'' (mixed strategy). Firms that conduct in-house innovation activities (``make only'') have the greatest impact on employment; the ``make and buy'' strategy comes in second. Similar results are found for small firms. These results highlight the importance of fostering in-house technological efforts not only for innovation per se, but also to promote growth in firm employment. The impact of ``make only'' strategies is greater in high-tech industries, whereas ``make only'' and ``make and buy'' have a similar impact on employment in low-tech industries. Finally, the study provides evidence of the mechanisms through which innovation strategies affect employment. The findings show that innovation strategies enhance technological innovation, but their impact differs between product and process innovation. Product innovation is mainly motivated by inhouse technology investments, followed by mixed strategies, whereas process innovation is basically driven by ``buy'' strategies.},
