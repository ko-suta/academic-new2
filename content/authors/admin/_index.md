I am an assistant professor at [Shohoku College](https://www.shohoku.ac.jp/index.html).
My interests include **labor economics** 🧑‍🔧, **political economy** 💹 and **experimental economics** 🧪. 
In my dissertation, I explored how the pursuit of the shareholder-value ideology by management has affected labor policies at large Japanese enterprises 🎏🏗.

My current research project focuses on the market perception of corporate innovations in Japan 🗾.
It is funded by the JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists.

My entire workflow is based on {{< icon name="r-project" pack="fab" style="color: #3584e4;" >}}{{< icon name="square-plus" pack="fab" >}}{{< icon name="markdown" pack="fab" >}}.
I am conducting economic experiments with the `oTree` {{< icon name="python" pack="fab" style="color: #26a269;" >}} package.
