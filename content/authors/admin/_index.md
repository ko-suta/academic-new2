I am a postdoc at Kochi University of Technology.
My interests include *corporate governance*, *labor economics* and *technological innovation*. 
In my dissertation, I explored how the pursuit of the shareholder-value ideology by management has affected labor policies at large Japanese enterprises.

My current research project focuses on the market perception of corporate innovations in Japan.
It is funded by the JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists.
