My interests include **labor economics**üßë‚Äçüîß, **political economy** and **experimental economics** üéØ.
In my dissertation, I explored how the pursuit of the shareholder-value ideology by management has affected labor policies at large Japanese enterprises üéè.

My current research project focuses on the market perception of corporate innovations in Japan üóæ.
It is funded by the JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists.
